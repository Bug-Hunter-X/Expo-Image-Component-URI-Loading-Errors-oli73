This bug occurs when using the Expo `Image` component with a URI that is not properly formatted or points to a non-existent resource.  It can manifest in several ways, including a blank space where the image should be, an error in the console, or unexpected behavior in the app.  The underlying issue is usually related to the way Expo handles image loading and caching, potentially exacerbated by network issues or incorrect URI handling.
