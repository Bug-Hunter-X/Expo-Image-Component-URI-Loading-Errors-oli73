# Expo Image Component URI Loading Errors

This repository demonstrates a common but difficult-to-diagnose bug related to the Expo `Image` component's URI handling.  The bug causes images to fail to load from certain URIs, resulting in unexpected behavior in the application.

## Problem

The `Image` component in Expo may fail to load images if the URI is malformed, inaccessible, or if network conditions prevent successful retrieval.  Standard error handling techniques might not always provide clear diagnostics.

## Solution

This example demonstrates a robust solution incorporating additional error handling and network checks to improve image loading reliability.  The solution includes proper URI validation, fallback mechanisms, and more informative error reporting.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to install dependencies.
3. Start the development server using `expo start`.
